# 🏛️ CivicAI – AI-Powered Civic Issue Reporting & Governance Platform

CivicAI is a full-stack **AI-powered civic governance platform** that enables citizens to report public infrastructure issues using images and allows municipal authorities to efficiently manage, assign, track, and resolve those issues through a transparent, data-driven system.

This project is designed as a **gov-tech / smart city solution** using modern AI, backend, and frontend technologies.

**CivicAI solves these problems by combining AI + digital governance**, creating a system where:
- Citizens can report issues instantly
- AI validates and categorizes complaints
- Authorities get structured dashboards
- Workers are tracked with accountability
- Decisions are driven by real data

## 🧠 Core Concept

> “Use AI as an assistant, not a replacement — with human oversight and accountability.”

CivicAI ensures:
- AI assists in detection
- Humans validate decisions
